## README

I thought it is better to delete promotion emails from my gmail account. 

I looked into https://github.com/mrishab/google-photos-delete-tool and I used Grok to imitate for the code for Gmail and after couple minutes of my trial and debugging efforts. I have got it working.

Just follow the same steps upto the Google Chrome console.
and Run the code in the console.
